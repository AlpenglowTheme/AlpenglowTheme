# Alpenglow v. 1.0.0

Alpenglow is the spiritual successor to the [Afterglow theme](https://github.com/YabataDesign/afterglow-theme), a minimal dark UI theme and syntax color scheme for Sublime Text 2 and 3.
The theme is based on the [Spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) theme.
The syntax color scheme is mostly derived from [idlefingers](http://idlefingers.co.uk/).

This version contains exactly the same features as pre-release v. 0.9.9, but has the following improvements over the latest version of Afterglow (v. 2.1.2):

 - Support for bold and italics in LaTeX, Markdown, ... (@vikjam)
